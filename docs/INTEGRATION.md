# Hadolint Integrations

## Travis CI

Integration with Travis CI requires minimal changes and adding less than
two seconds to your build time.

```yaml
# Use container-based infrastructure for quicker build start-up
sudo: false
# Use generic image to cut start-up time
language: generic
env:
  # Path to 'hadolint' binary
  HADOLINT: "${HOME}/hadolint"
install:
  # Download hadolint binary and set it as executable
  - curl -sL -o ${HADOLINT} "https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/releases/download/v1.5.0/hadolint-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)"
    && chmod 700 ${HADOLINT}
script:
  # List files which name starts with 'Dockerfile'
  # eg. Dockerfile, Dockerfile.build, etc.
  - git ls-files --exclude='Dockerfile*' --ignored | xargs --max-lines=1 ${HADOLINT}
```

## Gitlab CI

Add the following job to your projects `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
lint_dockerfile:
  stage: lint
  image: docker:latest
  services:
    - docker:dind
  script:
    - docker run --rm -i hadolint/hadolint < Dockerfile
```

Alternatively if you would rather run the hadolint image directly, there is a `debian-slim` variant available:
```yaml
lint_dockerfile:
  stage: lint
  image: hadolint/debian-slim-<version>
  script:
    - hadolint < Dockerfile
```

## Editors

Using hadolint in your terminal is not always the most convinient way, but it
can be integrated into your editor to give you a feedback as you write your
Dockerfile.
